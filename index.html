		<h2>Breakfast</h2>
			<img src="">
			<p>After I wake I go straight to the food bowl. It's my favorite part of the morning unless my sister decides to toss up her breakfast.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Litterbox Break</h2>
			<img src="">
			<p>I tried to beat my sister to the box but I was too late. She drops a turd in protest outside the pet supply door. She runs off and I'm left alone when my human comes in the room and accuses me of turd bomb.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Mid-Morning Nap</h2>
			<img src="">
			<p>After getting yelled at, I get to enjoy a break.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Lunch</h2>
			<img src="">
			<p>Same old thing in the bowl. I decided to grab an extra snack.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Afternoon</h2>
			<img src="">
			<p>Nap time again.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Evening</h2>
			<img src="">
			<p>After dinner I enjoy snuggle time with my humans.</p>
